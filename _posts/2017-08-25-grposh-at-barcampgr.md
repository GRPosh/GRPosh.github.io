Hi everyone!

For next months meetup we are going to be replacing our standard meeting by encouraging you to attend, and possibly present at (BarcampGR)[barcampgr.org].

For those of you who have never attended barcamp, its a free conference held here in Grand Rapids, the only rule for attending is that they ask you participate in the conference in some way.  Either, by presenting or by volunteering.  There is no real requirements for presenting, should you choose to do so.  Topics can be about anything thing, literally anything.  It is a really great event, and we high recommend you check it out.

Be sure and register on their site as seating is limited.

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the #event-topics channel on slack.

If you are unable to make it, we have begun recording most sessions, you can find them on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9jg2gj9alnFVCXuRuEVaA).
