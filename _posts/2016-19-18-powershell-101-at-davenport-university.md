Most of you attending have used PowerShell quite a bit but I wanted to give a starters talk for those who may be interested in PowerShell but have never gotten into it (*cough* bring your coworkers *cough *cough*).

Agenda will be:

* Introduction to PowerShell
* PowerShell vs Other Scripting Languages
* Tips for Exploring PowerShell
* The only 3 PowerShell commands you'll ever need to remember The talk will be held in Sneden Auditorium (Parking lots E or F).

P.S. Don't forget to let Thomas Malkewitz (@dotps1) or Micah Rairdon (@tiberriver256)  know if any of you have something cool to share and want to do a talk (15min - 1hr).
