This months session will be from [Thomas Malkewitz (@dotps1)](https://dotps1.github.io), and using his [WinSCP PowerShell Wrapper Module](https://github.com/dotps1/WinSCP) to interface with the [WinSCP](https://winscp.net) .net library and use WinSCP like it is native to PowerShell.

The session will be broken into two halves:
1. Module design overview.
2. Module usage.

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the [#event-topics channel](https://grposh.slack.com/messages/C2EFE0G8L/) on slack.
