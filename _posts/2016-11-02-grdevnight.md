Due to some very hectic schedules this past month (hence the late publishing of this artical) GRPosh will not be taking place this month.  However, a few of us will be attending [GRDevNight](http://grdevnight.org).  You can find details and registration info there.

We will be back in December, and Keith LeValley (@gr_devops) will be giving a presentation.  Keep an eye out on the #events Slack channel for up comming info on that.

Thanks everyone.
