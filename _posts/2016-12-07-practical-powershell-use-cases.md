For next meeting Keith LeValley (@gr_devops) has a few scripts that he would like to show that he has used for practical solutions to a few problems that have come up over the last month or so.  
This will also include a pretty cool trick for generating reports for smaller companies that may not have a large management systems like SCCM.  
He would like to highlight how PowerShell handles remoting and methods.  
Hopefully this will show how PowerShell can use the .Net framework to be really powerful while at the same time making it very simple for those who are not programmers to use.

The talk will begin at 6:00, but there will be pre talk networking from 5:30-6:00.  
We also will be meeting at Peppinos South (1515 Eastport Drive SE Grand Rapids, MI 49508) for some appetizers after the meeting.

Hope to see everyone there.
