It has been a while since our last meeting (way too long infact), so a few of us are going to get together and discuss a revamp of GRPosh, and how we would like to go forward.
If you'd like to be included in this discussion, please join us at Osgood Brewing in Grandville and share your thoughts and opinions!

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the [#event-topics channel](https://grposh.slack.com/messages/C2EFE0G8L/) on slack.

If you are unable to make it, we have begun recording each session, you can find them on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9jg2gj9alnFVCXuRuEVaA).
