This month we are going to be doing something a little different.  I ([@dotps1](https://dotps1.github.io/)) will be doing a much shorter demo (targeting about a half hour) on ways to customize and tweak the shell.  I will be showing some of the tricks and customization's I use that you may not be aware of that can be done with the shell.

For the second half hour, I would like every one to come prepared with at least one tip or trick that they could share with everyone else.  You can either demonstrate it or you can also just explain it and I can attempt to re create it for everyone else.  Even if you don't think you know any tricks, I am sure you know something or do something that someone else will find interesting and possibly helpful.  If you truly cannot think of anything to share, then try to come with something in mind that bugs you or irritates you that would like to see corrected and we can see if we can solve it as a group.  Teamwork!

Keith LeValley (@gr_devops), our gracious host, has reserved us a room in the new building that was recently finished, it is located behind the main campus, we will be meeting in room 210.

The talk will begin at 6:00, but there will be pre talk networking from 5:30-6:00.  
We also will be going to Peppinos South (1515 Eastport Drive SE Grand Rapids, MI 49508) for some appetizers and fellowship after the meeting.

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the #event-topics channel on slack.
