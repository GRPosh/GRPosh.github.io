Join us for a quick walk-through from Micah Rairdon ([@tiberriver256](http://tiberriver256.github.io/)) on using PSWebServer to quickly set up a tiny, but secure webservice to allow simple things like moving computer OUs in an MDT task sequence with Invoke-RestMethod or build a simple website (using your old hta skills) to let others run your PowerShell scripts with different credentials and without letting them know they are using PowerShell.

Keith LeValley (@gr_devops), our gracious host, has reserved us a room in the new building that was recently finished, it is located behind the main campus, we will be meeting in room 210.

The talk will begin at 6:00, but there will be pre talk networking from 5:30-6:00.  
We also will be going to Peppinos South (1515 Eastport Drive SE Grand Rapids, MI 49508) for some appetizers and fellowship after the meeting.

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the #event-topics channel on slack.
