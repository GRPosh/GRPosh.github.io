Hi everyone!

For next months meetup we are going to be replacing our standard meetup with an encouragement to attend and possibly present at BarcampGR.

There is no pressure to present but if you do let the rest of the group know so we can attend. We can list them here on the invite too. There are going to be lots of great talks and presentations.

Thomas Malkewitz will be presenting regarding using REST APIs with PowerShell.
Micah Rairdon will be presenting a PowerShell 30 minute beginner crash course and a talk on Designing PowerShell GUIs in Visual Studio Community Edition.

Be sure and register on their site as seating is limited.
