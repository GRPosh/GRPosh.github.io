This month we thought we'd do things a little bit different, rather then one person presenting on a specific topic, we thought we do something a little more engaging.  We will be having a PowerShell hackathon.  Bring a PowerShell project with you to get feedback or help from other members of the group. Don't have a project yet? Bring a mundane task you would like automated and as a group we can brainstorm some different ways to automate it in PowerShell. We'll spend the whole time tinkering away with PowerShell!

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the #event-topics channel on slack.

If you are unable to make it, we have begun recording each session, you can find them on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9jg2gj9alnFVCXuRuEVaA).
