After the recent WannaCry/WannaCrypt malware out break, IT Pros all over the world where faced with the same task of verifying that all systems where properly patched and that SMB1 is shutdown.
Join us for a presentation from Thomas Malkewitz ([@dotps1](https://dotps1.github.io)) on how he used PowerShell Jobs and CIM to quickly scan thousands of systems to ensure they where properly patched and not at risk for this exploit.

Hope to see everyone there.

Also, if you have anything you would like to present at any upcoming meetings, or something you would like to see presented on, please share your ideas in the #event-topics channel on slack.
