We'll cover working with the following more common types of APIs using PowerShell: OpenAPI / Swagger, OData, Good ol' SOAP. Automatically generated PowerShell modules for OpenAPI via http://editor.swagger.io/#/. Automatically generated PowerShell modules via Export-ODataEndpointProxy. Connecting to SOAP services via New-WebServiceProxy.

Hope to see everyone there.
