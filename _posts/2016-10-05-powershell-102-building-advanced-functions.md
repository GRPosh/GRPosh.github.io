We are going to continue our entry into powershell talks for our newer members.  Thomas Malkewitz (@dotps1) will be giving a talk on how to build PowerShell Advanced Functions.
We will take an _everyday task_ and turn it into an Advanced Function from the inside out.

Agenda will be:

* Advanced Function Sturcture.
* Utilizing the Pipeline.
* Parameter Binding.

There will also be networking before hand from 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM.

Please don't forget to RSVP in the #events channel.  Hope to see everyone there!

P.S. if you have anything you'd like to present or topics you'd like to see presented on, please post in the #topics channel.
